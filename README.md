# The Cocoon: Where Social Butterflies Thrive ðŸ¦‹

## Description

Technology is a beautiful thing. It allows us to make friends from all over the world! Unfortunately, those friends may also be in different time zones or may be hiking in the middle of a desert with no Wi-Fi. Whatever the case, sometimes it's hard to share your current, most pressing thoughts with your friends. But with The Cocoon, now you can post your thoughts whenever they come to you, and your friends can reply with their opinion whenever they're free!
